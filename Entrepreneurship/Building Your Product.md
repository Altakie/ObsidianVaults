- You have to make sure your product is actually wanted by consumers before committing a lot of effort to it
- Ways to do this:
	- Create an [[MVP (Minimum Viable Product)]]
	- Interact directly with customers to learn more about them
- Execution is more important than the idea
- Build --> Measure --> Learn --> Repeat
- [[Learning]] is the most important part of the startup process
- Need to know when to [[Pivot]]
- The more specific the product the better
- [[Funnel]] customers into your product
