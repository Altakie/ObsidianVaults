# Regular Operations
- Operations on languages
## Types of Regular Operations
### Union
- Anything that is in one set or the other set
### Concatenation
- Adding everything in one set to another set, not as another element, but creating new elements that are combinations of the elements of both sets
	- $A^1 \circ A = A^2$
	- $\circ$ represents concatenation operation
### Star
- 0 or more copies of something
### Plus
- 1 or more copies of something



# Closure
- A collection of objects is closed under an operation if applying that operation to any object in the collection results in another object within the collection
- Regular languages are closed under union, concatenation, and star
- Closed under reverse (compliment)
- Closed under intersection

# Ways to Express
- DFA or NFA
